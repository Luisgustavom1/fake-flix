# Fakeflix Architecture Principles

**You MUST read `docs/ARCHITECTURE-GUIDELINES.md` and `docs/MODULAR-ARCHITECTURE-GUIDELINES.md` when:**

- Creating or modifying module structure
- Questions about architectural patterns
- Naming conventions for services/entities/DTOs
- Feature folder patterns
- Domain boundaries and dependencies

**How to load it:**
Use the `read` tool to load the file before providing architectural guidance.

**Context7 MCP**
Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or
library/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP
tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.
